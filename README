Classloader which instruments loaded classes for example to remove final modifiers.
It may be useful if for example some classes cannot be changed is used in current code.
Without final modifiers it becomes possible to stub these classes and write unit test
for the code you work on.

See org.definilizer.ClassLoaderForTesting for info on how it can be used.
